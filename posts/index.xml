Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,</description></item><item><title>When you are old</title><link>https://hirozy.com/posts/when-you-are-old/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2015 22:29:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hirozy.com/posts/when-you-are-old/</guid><description>William Butler Yeats, 1865-1939 When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;
How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;</description></item></channel></rss>
